This is the first project created through the Odin Project, based around learning git, and HTML + CSS. 

For this project, I am going to learn how to use Dev Tools to inspect and replicate a webpage, specifically Google's homepage, and if I want a challenge, Google's search results page. 

The skills I'll be using to complete this are:
> Knowledge of the command line
> Knowledge of git and version control
> Knowledge of Html + CSS
